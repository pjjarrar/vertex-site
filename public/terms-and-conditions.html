                        <h4>Indemnification</h4>
                        <p>The Zachman Group, LLC ("TZG") offers Ground Penetrating Radar ("GPR") and Electromagnetic
                            Detection ("EM") locating services. Due to GPR and EM limitations, The Zachman Group cannot
                            guarantee it will be able to locate all relevant items on a project. The decision to proceed
                            with cutting, coring, drilling, vertical boring, directional boring, or excavation is left
                            entirely up to the customer. We do not conduct a study, investigation, analysis, or
                            interpretation of soil composition, soil conditions, or other aspects of the physical earth.
                            We do not conduct a study, investigation, analyst of concrete composition, compaction rate,
                            load rate or moisture content. We report retrieved data only. We do NOT provide geophysical,
                            geological, engineering, structural engineering or land surveying services. Please contact a
                            geophysicist, geologist, engineer, structural engineer or land surveyor if you are seeking
                            the provision of geophysical, geological, engineering, structural engineering or land
                            surveying service.</p>
                        <p>Due to GPR and EM limitations, and other factors, The Zachman Group CANNOT guarantee all
                            items will be detected and/or labeled correctly.</p>
                        <p>The customer is responsible for maintenance and integrity of the markings for future use. The
                            Zachman Group does not guarantee how long onsite markings will last. The Zachman Group
                            assumes no responsibility –and will not mobilize again for marking—once The Zachman Group
                            has marked out the designated areas.</p>
                        <p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, THE CUSTOMER HEREBY AGREES TO
                            ASSUME THE ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR, AND AGREES TO RELEASE, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY
                            AND HOLD THE ZACHMAN GROUP, ITS AFFILIATES, OWNERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
                            AND SUCCESSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL
                            CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ATTORNEYS' FEES,
                            COURT COSTS, EXPERT WITNESS FEES AND ANY OTHER COST OF DEFENSE) FOR AND ARISING OUT OF THE
                            SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE ZACHMAN GROUP TO THE CUSTOMER. THIS OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND
                            AND RELEASE APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE CLAIM OR LOSS IS OCCASIONED BY OR
                            RESULTS FROM THE ACTUAL OR ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE OF THE ZACHMAN GROUP OR ANY OTHER PERSON, OR
                            ENTITY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, WHETHER SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
                            THE CLAIM OR LOSS IS DUE TO THE ZACHMAN GROUP'S SOLE NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
                            MISCONDUCT.</p>
                        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ZACHMAN GROUP OR ITS AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, OR FOR THE LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, OR FOR
                            LOSS OF USE, WHETHER RESULTING IN ANY MANNER FROM SERVICES FURNISHED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
                            FROM THE ZACHMAN GROUP'S BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATION OF THE ZACHMAN GROUP
                            UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF DAMAGES AND DISCLAIMER OF SPECIAL,
                            INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SHALL APPLY TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER ASSERTED
                            AGAINST THE ZACHMAN GROUP PERTAINING TO THE PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES OR
                            OF THE ZACHMAN GROUP'S OTHER OBLICATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
                        <p>THE ZACHMAN GROUP MAKES NO, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL, WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
                            IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE NATURE, QUANTITY OR QUALITY OF THE SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED
                            HEREUNDER. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF ITS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, THE ZACHMAN
                            GROUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE CUSTOMER FOR ANY DAMAGES AS A RESULT OF ITS PERFORMANCE OR
                            FAILURE TO PERFORM THE SERVICES.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-5">Concrete Scanning</h4>
                        <p>GPR and EM are tools used to assist with locating the placement of conduits, post tension
                            cables, wire mesh, voiding, rebar and other structural elements in concrete. While these
                            technologies assist with mitigating risk of striking or cutting unwanted items, they are not
                            without limitations. There are many variables that can affect the accuracy of both GPR and
                            EM. These variables include without limitation stacked items, large amounts of reinforcing,
                            age of concrete, moisture content of concrete, concrete thickness, surface conditions, etc.
                            Each technology can produce false positives and false negatives. This means that there is a
                            possibility an item thought to be detected may not exist, or that there is an item that does
                            exist and is not identified. Additionally, GPR is unable to scan within three inches (3")
                            leading up to any protrusion relating to the scan surface.</p>
                        <p>The decision to proceed with cutting, coring, drilling, demolition is left entirely up to the
                            customer, and customer assumes all risk. Additionally, when these activities do occur,
                            customer agrees to stay no less than two inches (2") vertically and horizontally away from
                            the marked-out items unless otherwise specified by Vertex.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-5">Subsurface Locating</h4>
                        <p>GPR and EM are tools to assist with the locating of subsurface utilities, underground storage
                            tanks and other manufactured subsurface objects. While these tools have been used for
                            locating the aforementioned items with successful results, they are not without limitations.
                            There are many variables that can affect the accuracy of both GPR and EM. These variables
                            include without limitation soil composition, terrain, surface conditions, etc. Each
                            technology can produce false positives and false negatives. This means that there is a
                            possibility an item thought to be detected may not exist, or that there is an item that does
                            exist and is not identified.</p>
                        <p>The decision to proceed with cutting, coring, drilling, boring, demolition, directional
                            drilling or excavation is left entirely up to the customer, and customer assumes all risk.
                            Additionally, customer should follow all state and local laws when these activities do occ.
                            Customer agrees to stay no less than thirty-six inches (36") vertically and horizontally
                            away from the marked-out items unless otherwise specified by The Zachman Group.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-5">Global Positioning System (GPS) Mapping</h4>
                        <p>The Zachman Group offers KMZ files of detected findings (if in contract). While these files
                            assist with knowledge to the placement of utilities and other subsurface items, they are not
                            professional land survey grade maps/files and should not be used and or considered as such.
                            Collected information is subject to GPS/GIS mapping unit accuracy (sub-meter) unless
                            otherwise specified by The Zachman Group. Customer fully understands and acknowledges that
                            The Zachman Group is not a professional land surveying company and or organization, and that
                            The Zachman Group does not solicit as, or make claim(s) as a professional land surveying
                            company and or organization.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-5">"One Call" or "811" Services</h4>
                        <p>The Zachman Group is not associated to or acts in part as a "One Call" or "811" service.
                            Hiring The Zachman Group does not constitute as a "One Call" or "811" service and does not
                            mitigate the need for these services. The Zachman Group provides services at a cost to the
                            customer. Hiring The Zachman Group does not negate the responsibility of the customer to
                            follow all state and local laws. Additionally, The Zachman Group does not execute the hiring
                            of "811" or "One Call" services, the responsibility to hire these entities is left entirely
                            up to the customer.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-5">Licensing</h4>
                        <p>The Zachman Group, LLC does not provide, markets as, or is/are a licensed professional, a
                            licensed/professional engineer, civil engineer, structural engineer, land surveyor,
                            geophysicist, geologist, or cartographer. The Zachman Group provides retrieved data from
                            locating equipment. Any decisions made based on this retrieved data are left entirely up to
                            the customer.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-5">Layout</h4>
                        <p>The Zachman Group does not perform layouts. The customer understands that they are
                            responsible for the layout, size(s) and location(s) to be scanned. By signing, the customer
                            agrees that the correct layout, size(s) and location(s) have been scanned. If an area is
                            missing due to an incorrect layout or size, it will be treated as a separate project/cost.
                            Areas to be scanned should be free of obstruction(s) and easily accessible in a safe manner.
                            If this is not the situation, remobilization may be required at the cost of the customer.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mt-5">Markings</h4>
                        <p>The material used for marking is designed for precision and safety of detected items. There
                            is no guarantee these marks will last for a long or a short period of time. While The
                            Zachman Group's intent is never to use markings that can damage a surface, The Zachman Group

                            objection. Customer shall accept the Agreement, including the terms and conditions in this
                            document if: i) Customer has signed this document or any proposal to which these terms and

                            limitation of the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement shall govern over any conflicting
                            terms contained in any other writing related to the Services, including, but not limited to,
